     Introduction
     </b>
     <p>
          They used two strategies for LLM probing: Template Based and Naturally Sourced.
     </p>
     <b>
          Template Based
     </b>
     <p>
          They created template with placeholders for specific traits filled with adjective words from categories like Personality, Outlook, Communal, and Occupation. They got 2772 template sentences by combining both the
          categories
     </p>
